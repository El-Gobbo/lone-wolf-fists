# LWF System

![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green)

This is a system to play the post-apocalyptic anime inspired ttrpg Lone Wolf Fists using Foundry vtt. It has been built starting from the boilerplate system, and is currently not ready for wider use.

## To do
My current goal is to get a fully functional sheet for player characters. From there, I intend to put together sheets for all other actor classes (seriously, theres a lot of them), at which point this system should be at an alpha stage, and able to be used. I have not thought much beyond that, but I have a few initial ideas i'd like to explore

## List of intended changes before alpha
- Create basic character sheets for all actor classes
- Squads
-- Effort and health based on number of members - max 10 effort!
-- Effort and max heath go down as health decreases and members die
-- Most commonly used for squads of 10 health individuals
- Note tab for player characters
- Prana flare out of combat
